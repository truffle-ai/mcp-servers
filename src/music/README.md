## Installation & Usage

### As a Published Package (Recommended)

Once published to PyPI, you can run the server directly with:

```bash
uvx truffle-ai-music-creator-mcp
```

### Local Development

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Clone or navigate to this directory
cd /path/to/mcp-servers/src/music

# Install dependencies and run
uv run python main.py
```

### Testing with uvx

Test the server locally before publishing:

```bash
# From the music directory
uvx --from . music-creator-mcp
```

## MCP Client Configuration

### Saiki Configuration

Add to your `agent.yml`:

```yaml

## Example Usage

### Audio Analysis
```
"Analyze the tempo and key of my song.mp3"
"What's the BPM of this track?"
"What key is this song in?"
```

### Music Generation
```
"Create a melody in G major at 140 BPM for 15 seconds"
"Create a I-IV-V-I chord progression in D major"
"Create a basic rock drum pattern"
```

### Audio Processing
```
"Convert my song.wav to MP3 format"
"Increase the volume of my vocals by 3dB"
"Normalize my guitar track to -18dB"
"Trim my song from 30 seconds to 2 minutes"
```

### Audio Effects
```

"Add echo to my vocals with 500ms delay and 0.7 decay"
"Add some distortion to my bass track"
```

### Mixing & Playback
```
"Mix my vocals, guitar, and drums together with the vocals at +3dB"
"Mix a MIDI melody with an MP3 drum loop"
"Play my song.mp3 starting from 30 seconds for 10 seconds"
```

## Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **librosa**: Audio analysis and music information retrieval
- **pydub**: Audio file manipulation and processing
- **music21**: Music notation and analysis
- **pretty_midi**: MIDI file handling
- **numpy**: Numerical computing
- **scipy**: Scientific computing
- **matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization

### Optional Dependencies
- **pygame**: For audio and MIDI playback
- **ffmpeg**: For enhanced audio format support (recommended)

## Development

### Local Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run python test_functions.py

# Format code
uv run black main.py
uv run ruff check main.py
```

### Building and Publishing

```bash
# Build the package
uv build

# Publish to PyPI
uv publish

# Or publish to TestPyPI first
uv publish --repository testpypi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **FFmpeg warnings**: These can be safely ignored. The server includes fallback methods using librosa and soundfile.

2. **Large audio files**: Consider trimming or converting to smaller formats for faster processing.

3. **Memory usage**: Monitor system memory during heavy audio operations.

4. **pygame dependency**: Required for playback features. Install with: `uv add pygame`

### Performance Tips

- Install FFmpeg for optimal audio processing performance
- Use batch operations for multiple files
- Monitor system resources during heavy operations
- Consider using smaller audio formats for faster processing
